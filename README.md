# _Klebsiella oxytoca_ Species Complex surface polysaccharide locus databases

This repository houses a _Klebsiella oxytoca_ Species Complex (KoSC) capsule (K) locus database.

The database comprises 93 distinct K polysaccharide synthesis loci defined on the basis of distinct gene content, and identified from ~4400 publicly available KoSC genome sequences. (Distinct genes were defined at a translated amino acid identity threshold 83.5%.)

The database is comptabile with [Kaptive](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kaptive), enabling rapid typing of KoSC K loci from genome assemblies: Of 4,399 publicly available KoSC genomes tested, 97.7% had typeable K loci.

## License
